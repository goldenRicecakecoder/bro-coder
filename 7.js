// x = Math.floor(x); <-- this always rounds stuff down so x would be 3.14 but if x was 2.1499 it would be 2.14
// x = Math.ceil(x); <-- same as floor but rounds up always so 2.14 would be 2.15
// x = Math.sqrt(x); <-- finds square root
// x = Math.abs(x); <-- absolute value of x so if x was -1 it would change to 1 distance away frmo 0 basically
